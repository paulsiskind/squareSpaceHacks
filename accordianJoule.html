                Thank you for choosing the Joule Heat Energy Meter Kit by
                Amatis Controls. This <b>Installation Manual and User Guide</b>
                will guide you through the simple process of installing each
                component of your new Joule Kit and provide instructions to
                register the device on the web-based Energy Dashboard.
                Within an hour or so your system will be reporting valuable
                energy data to the Amatis Energy Dashboard, which you can
                access online. All components must be installed correctly to
                ensure the overall accuracy of this kit.

    <h3>2.0 Installing AMBR</h3>
    <div>
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>AMBR connects your JOULE system to the Internet. Follow
               the steps below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Connect one end of the blue Cat5/Ethernet wire to
                    the back of AMBR.</li>
                <li>Connect the other end of the blue Cat5/Ethernet
                    wire to an available Ethernet port.
                    NOTE: Some cable & DSL modems have only one Ethernet
                    port. In order to connect AMBR you may need to add
                    another Ethernet port. Ethernet Switches are available to
                    add more Ethernet ports to the same Internet connection.
                    One option is illustrated below:</li>
                <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54db9f6de4b088f32cfb6567/t/576c2fbf8419c2d258a3af63/1466707904957/CableAmbr.png">
                <li>Plug the barrel end of the white 5V power supply
                    into the back of AMBR and the plug into the wall
                    socket.</li>  
                <li>Wait for 1-2 minutes while AMBR boots up and
                    connects to the Internet.</li>
                <li>On the front of AMBR a blue blinking light confirms
                    AMBR has booted up correctly and is connected to
                    the Internet. You can move on to Section 3.0
                    INSTALLING TEMPERATURE SENSORS.</li>
                <li>If AMBR does not show a blinking blue light after 5
                    minutes, you may be experiencing an Internet
                    connectivity problem. Follow the troubleshooting
                    steps in the next section.</li>

                    length from bends, pumps or fittings on both sides</li>
                <li>Solder appropriately sized threaded unions to existing pipe on supply side</li>
                <li>Attach the low sensor fittings to the threaded unions</li>
                <li>Insert flow sensor assembly (with arrows on the sensor corresponding to the flow of fluid) </li>
                <li>Using the two large clips to connect the flow sensor to the fittings</li>
                <li>Clean all pipes of soldering remnants and all other debris. <i>NOTE: Be extremely careful not to expose flow sensor to
                    any cleaning agents.</i></li>
                <li>Connect the 4-pin sensor wire to the flow sensor after soldering, and all cleaning is complete.</li>

                <p><i>NOTE: the 4-pin connector fits snugly into the flow sensor. Once attached the plastic clips will engage to hold the 4- pin connecter in place.</i></p>

                <li>Ground the flow meter by attaching the grounding strap to the pipework next to the flow sensor.
                    Tighten nut on ground strap to ground cable hookterminal. The ground cable will attach to the RJ11 input on the Joule meter. </li>
                <li>The RJ11 plug on the opposite end of the flow sensor wire will connect to the JOULE heat meter. See next section. </li>

            <p>Once all sensors are installed properly, successful JOULE
               installation is plug-and-play. Simply follow the steps below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Plug flow sensor wire into the RJ11 terminal labeled “Flow Meter.”</li>
                <li>Plug supply temperature sensor wire into RJ11 terminal labeled “Supply Temp.”</li>
                <li>Plug return temperature sensor wire into RJ11 terminal labeled “Return Temp.” </li>
                <li>Plug grounding wire into RJ11 terminal labeled “Ground.”</li>
                <li>Plug JOULE power supply into a nearby outlet.</li>
                <li>Indicator lights on JOULE will begin to light up.</li>
                <li>Confirm JOULE is reading flow by manually
                    controlling the pump and looking for the Yellow LED
                    indicator. Indicator will be on with flow greater than
                    1.5 L/min</li>
